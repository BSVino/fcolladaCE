successfully merged and build OMK fcollada and WF fcollada. O3D fcollada uses chrome basetypes, requires more work to fix and bring over.

While building 0AD from wildfire games I got this error:
../../../libraries/fcollada/lib/libFColladaSR.a(FCDocument.o): In function `FCDocument::FCDocument()':
FCDocument.cpp:(.text+0x107f): undefined reference to `FCDScene::FCDScene(FCDocument*, FUObject*)'

collect2: ld returned 1 exit status

don't quite get it - haven't looked into it yet

TODO:
need to put 64 bit guards in FUStringBuilder.h
probably autotools build based on the WF makefile (I know it better than cmake).
test code with 0AD
finish doxygen?

Feeling Software created the fcollada library(last released in 2008), but has since stopped support. There are no available downloads or information on fcollada on feeling software's website.

Multiple projects now use this library, each adding their own patches.

This project is an attempt to bring all the community ports together into a single release where seperate projects can contribute and collaborate.

The upstream source is difficult to find, but I believe I found a copy of the latest release (3.05B) here:
